# About us

We're a big project consisting of 10 busy developers, that work on Cypher in their spare time and whenever we have a new suggested feature! Cypher has grown insanely vver the past 2 months, we've reached our goals to get 250k members and 100 guilds and we got that! We strive to achieve **500k** members and **200** guilds by the end of the year.  

Cypher is filled with loads of goodies and :sparkles: *schwag* :sparkles: to entertain everyone of your server. Don't believe us? What do you think of our gradient command, it allows you to create a gradient from role A to B with any HEX you like! 

Don't want that? What about a feature that saves all your server data from upcoming raids. We got it all and we're still working on more behind the scenes.
